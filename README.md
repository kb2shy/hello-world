# hello-world
First project on GitHub and learning how to use it

Hello people of the interwebs,

I have just started to learn how to program in Java and looking to become a software developer.  I'm changing career paths and looking to accomplish something better in life.  Got any pointers, advice, or amazing sources of information that you would be willing to share?  I would greatly appreciate it.  Cheers!
